\title{Plot Partial Correlations as an igraph Graph}
\usage{
PlotPartialCorrelationGraph(
  rbmObject,
  features = NULL,
  nEdges = 50,
  nFeatures = 50,
  layout = c("fr", "kk"),
  main = "Partial Correlation Graph",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rbmObject}{An RBM object fitted using FitRBM().}

\item{features}{Optional character vector of features (genes) to include.
If NULL, features are chosen from the strongest partial correlations.}

\item{nEdges}{Integer. If features is NULL, use the top nEdges absolute partial
correlations as candidate edges (default: 50).}

\item{nFeatures}{Optional integer. If provided and features is NULL, cap the
number of vertices to this value by keeping features with the strongest
incident edge weights (default: 50).}

\item{layout}{Character. Graph layout algorithm: "fr" (Fruchterman-Reingold)
or "kk" (Kamada-Kawai) (default: "fr").}

\item{main}{Plot title (default: "Partial Correlation Graph").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments forwarded to igraph::plot().}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with elements: graph (igraph), layout (numeric matrix).
}
\description{
Visualizes the (subsampled) partial correlation matrix as an undirected graph.
By default, only the strongest edges are used to avoid rendering extremely large
graphs for typical single-cell feature sets.
