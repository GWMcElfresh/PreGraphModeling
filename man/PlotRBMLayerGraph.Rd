\title{Plot RBM Layers and Activations as an igraph Graph}
\usage{
PlotRBMLayerGraph(
  rbmObject,
  features = NULL,
  factors = NULL,
  nFeatures = 50,
  main = "RBM Layer Graph",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rbmObject}{An RBM object fitted using FitRBM().}

\item{features}{Optional character vector of visible features to include.
If NULL, selects the top nFeatures by weight magnitude approximately evenly
across the chosen factors (default: NULL).}

\item{factors}{Optional character vector of hidden factors (layers) to include.
If NULL, uses all rbmObject$hidden_factors (default: NULL).}

\item{nFeatures}{Integer. If features is NULL, select approximately this many
visible features across layers (default: 50).}

\item{main}{Plot title (default: "RBM Layer Graph").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments forwarded to igraph::plot().}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list with elements: graph (igraph), layout (numeric matrix).
}
\description{
Visualizes the RBM architecture as a simple bipartite graph: visible features
connected to hidden layers (metadata factors). Edges are aggregated per
feature-factor pair using the maximum absolute weight across that factor's
hidden units. This keeps the plot interpretable while still highlighting
which hidden layers are most connected to which genes.
