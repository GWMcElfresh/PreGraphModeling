\usage{
PlotRBMWeightsHeatmap(

)
}
\arguments{
\item{rbmObject}{An RBM object fitted using FitRBM().}

\item{features}{Optional character vector of specific features to plot.
If NULL, plots all features (default: NULL).}

\item{factors}{Optional character vector of specific hidden factors to plot.
If NULL, plots all factors (default: NULL).}

\item{nFeatures}{Integer. If `features` is NULL, select approximately this many
visible features to display by splitting the budget across the selected factors
(default: 50).}

\item{cluster_rows}{Logical indicating whether to cluster rows (default: TRUE).}

\item{cluster_columns}{Logical indicating whether to cluster columns (default: FALSE).}

\item{show_row_names}{Logical indicating whether to show row names (default: TRUE).}

\item{show_column_names}{Logical indicating whether to show column names (default: TRUE).}

\item{color_palette}{Character string specifying color palette (default: "RdBu").}

\item{title}{Character string for heatmap title (default: "RBM Weights").}

\item{name}{Character string for color legend name (default: "Weight").}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap().}
}
\value{
A ComplexHeatmap object that can be drawn or further customized.
}
\description{
Creates a heatmap visualization of the weight matrix from an RBM, showing
the connections between visible features and hidden factors.
}
\details{
The heatmap displays the learned weights connecting visible features (genes)
to hidden factors (metadata). Strong positive weights indicate features that
activate when the factor is present, while negative weights indicate suppression.

\dontrun{
# Fit RBM
rbm <- FitRBM(pbmc, hiddenFactors = c("CellType", "Treatment"), family = "zinb")

# Plot weights
weight_plot <- PlotRBMWeights(rbm)
print(weight_plot)

# Plot specific features and factors
weight_plot <- PlotRBMWeights(
  rbm,
  features = c("CD3D", "CD8A", "CD4"),
  factors = "CellType"
)
