Title: Subsetting and Zero-Inflated Modeling for Single Cell Data
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("GW", "McElfresh", email = "mcelfreshgw@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Tools for subsetting Seurat objects according to metadata columns and 
    fitting zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate distribution parameters.
    Supports residualization of technical covariates (e.g., cellular saturation) using 
    generalized additive models (GAM) to improve model fit quality. Includes restricted
    Boltzmann machine (RBM) functionality for connecting features to hidden layers
    using partial correlations estimated via quasilikelihood.
